# QSAR_TLR7
The goal of this project was to identify potential new TLR7 agonists using purely versatile computational tools. We built a statisticall-inspired modification of partial least squares regression (SIMPLS) QSAR model based on previously known TLR7 agonists, we screened DrugBank database for potentail new compounds acting as TLR7 binders via molecular docking, then screened the docked coompounds using our previously trained model, and finally we evaluated the binding residency of some of the top compounds using molecular dynamics. Suprisingly, the identified compounds ( a majority being a cephalosporin or a nucleotide analogue) had been displayed antiviral activity in other studies, and thus, this study revelaed (at least one of the) underlying mechanism behind their antiviral activity (i.e., TLR7 agonism).
